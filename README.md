This is a notes app I created using Dart/Flutter, Firebase, Firestore, Flutter Bloc and initially SQLite before I migrated to using a cloud database. I followed Vandad's tutorial, Flutter for Beginners on YouTube. This independent project was inspired by my friend who suffers from OCD and struggles with completing tasks and organising her notes related to her business on her phone. Therefore, I created this application so that she can organise her notes/ to do list easily.
